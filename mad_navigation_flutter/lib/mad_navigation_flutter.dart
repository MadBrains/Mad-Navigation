/// Integration with Flutter: connects navigation with widgets and routers
///
/// This package provides Flutter-specific implementations and widgets that
/// integrate the navigation logic from `package:mad_navigation` and
/// `package:mad_navigation_impl` with Flutter's widget tree and navigation system.
///
/// To use this in your Flutter app, import the library:
/// ```dart
/// import 'package:mad_navigation_flutter/mad_navigation_flutter.dart';
/// ```
