/// Pure Dart: navigation interfaces and abstractions, independent of Flutter
///
/// This package provides core navigation abstractions and interfaces that are
/// platform-agnostic and can be used across different Dart applications.
/// It follows clean architecture principles to separate navigation logic from implementation.
///
/// To get started, import the library:
/// ```dart
/// import 'package:mad_navigation/mad_navigation.dart';
/// ```
